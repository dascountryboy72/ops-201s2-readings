A How To Guide on installing git on Mac, Windows and Linux. 

First it is important to realize what github is, and the purpose of git. 
Github.com is a respitory system that allows enterprises, coders, programers, individuals and more to collaborate and work on projects as a team or independantly. Github.com also allows others to add comments to your projects so long as you allow these permissions in your settings. 
Git on the otherhand is the command line interface that allows for these projects, respitories and functions to be uploaded on the website as well as your local computer.
